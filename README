A personal project currently in development. Using python with tkinter I have been creating a multiplayer drinking game designed to run on any operating system (currently optimised for linux). It's a party game to be displayed on a TV or large screen and will give drinking instructions and games to players. It takes names as input, supporting a multitude of players, the only limitation being how many entry boxes can be fit on the screen.
